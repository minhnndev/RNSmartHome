      Choices You may be able to refuse or disable Cookies by adjusting your
      browser settings. Because each browser is different, please consult the
      instructions provided by your browser. Please note that you may need to
      take additional steps to refuse or disable certain types of Cookies. For
      example, due to differences in how browsers and mobile apps function, you
      may need to take different steps to disable Cookies used for targeted
      advertising in a browser and to disable targeted advertising for a mobile
      application, which you may control through your device settings or mobile
      app permissions. In addition, our choice to disable cookies is specific to
      the particular browser or device that you are using when you disable
      cookies, so you may need to separately disable cookies for each type of
      browser or device. If you choose to refuse, disable, or delete Cookies,
      some of the functionality of the Platform may no longer be available to
      you. Without this information, we are not able to provide you with all the
      requested services, and any differences in services are related to your
      information. You can manage third-party advertising preferences for some
      of the third parties we work with to serve advertising across the Internet
      by clicking here and by utilizing the choices available at
      www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_our.asp and
      www.aboutads.info/choices. Your mobile device may include a feature that
      allows you to opt out of some types of targeted advertising (“Limit Ad
      Tracking” on iOS and “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” on Android). You can
      opt out of marketing or advertising emails by utilizing the “unsubscribe”
      link or mechanism noted in marketing or advertising emails. You can switch
      off GPS location information functionality on your mobile device if you do
      not wish to share GPS information. If you have registered for an account
      you may access, review, and update certain personal information that you
      have provided to us by logging into your account and using available
      features and functionalities. Some browsers transmit “do-not-track”
      signals to websites. Because of differences in how browsers incorporate
      and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for
      these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.
      We currently do not take action in response to these signals. Security We
      use reasonable measures to help protect information from loss, theft,
      misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
      You should understand that no data storage system or transmission of data
      over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100
      percent secure. Please note that information collected by third parties
      may not have the same security protections as information you submit to
      us, and we are not responsible for protecting the security of such
      information. Children The privacy of users under the age of 13 (“Younger
      Users”) is important to us. We provide a separate experience for Younger
